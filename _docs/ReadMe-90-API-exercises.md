# Exercises

So far you have practiced the creation of API endpoints for the books.

In this section you will be continuing your practice. There will also be
references to parts 7 and 8 of this series. When we do, you will be, at
first, expected to follow the section through then return to these
exercises.

These exercises are divided into sections. The idea is to create the features of the project step by step.

## Books, Authors, Publishers and More

The relationships between the three tables, Books, Authors and Publishers is shown in the ER Diagram below.

Some key points to note from it are:
- An author may have many books
- A book belongs to many authors
- A book belongs to a publisher
- A publisher has many books

Due to the many authors to many books we needed to create a 'pivot' table.

This is the author-books table.

> â€¼ **IMPORTANT** â€¼
>
> Ensure you verify the most up-to-date version of the
> database structure shown in the ERD in the document
> [ReadMe-00-Library-ER.md](ReadMe-00-Library-ER.md) and update any
> data structures as required.

# Exercises

Complete each of these exercises. They are split into each of
the BREAD/CRUD actions.

# 1 Book Exercises

## Exercise 1-01: Create skeleton for Books API

- Create the resourceful controller skeleton for the Books API
- Create the resourceful route for the Books API

> Remember that the Books API will be `API/BooksAPIController`

## Exercise 1-02: Create Books Index API method

- Edit the API/BooksAPIController and have the index method return
  **all the books**
- Do a "brute force" Test using (`http://localhost/api/books`)[http://localhost/api/books]
- Create a Postman request to test using same URI

## Exercise 1-03: Create Show One Book API endpoint

- Edit the BooksAPIController and the show method for the Books API
- Make the methods return a single book given the `id` for the book
- Brute force test using (`http://localhost/api/books/45`)[http://localhost/api/books/45]
- Create a Postman request to test for an existing book
- Create a Postman request to test for a non-existent book

## Exercise 1-04: Add suitable error results

- Update your Book Index and Show methods to ensure they have suitable
  error results
- Update the Author index to also respond with a suitable error (when
  no authors in database)

---
### Exercise 1-05: Create the Books API create endpoint

- Add the `create` method to `BooksAPIController.php`.
- Make sure you verify all the required data is submitted.
- If the data is not submitted, it will return HTML for the time being,
  this is ok, until we look at error responses in a later stage.
- Store the new book in the database.

### Exercise 1-06: Test the create method

- Create a suitable test in Postman to verify that you create a record
  using the API only.
- Create a test to check that missing data provides the expected error
  messages in response.

### Exercise 1-07: Add the Book-Author relationship

- Update the book create API endpoint so that when a book is added,
  its author is linked via the author-book model.
- The Author is passed as TWO text fields (family name(s) or corporate
  name, and an optional, null if omitted, given name(s)).
- Using these two fields, check the author exists (if so use that id)
- If not create the author first, then use the new ID as the id.
- Refer to the seeders for help on this one.


### Exercise 1-08: Test the updated create method

- Create a suitable test in Postman to verify that you create a
  record (and link the associated author) using the API only.

### Exercise 1-09: Add multiple authors to a book

- When submitting the author details, allow for an 'array of
  authors' (with family name(s) or corporate name, and an
  optional, null if omitted, given name(s) for each author)
- Use this to add multiple authors, in a similar way to the previous problem.


### Exercise 1-10: Modify Author Create Request

Four improvements to be done with the author's create request:

- Update the author create so that if the author already exists then
  the author is returned.
- Ensure a suitable error message is given.
- Provide a suitable response code of 202 to represent the author was
  accepted but not created.
- If the author's given name is provided, and the family name is
  missing, move the given name into the family name.

## Exercise 1-11: Create Update Author


## Exercise 1-12: Test Update Author

## Exercise 1-13: Create Delete Author


## Exercise 1-14: Test Delete Author



# 2 Publisher Exercises

## Exercise 2-01: Publishers

Create the base requirements for publishers. 

The publisher details to be stored are:

| Field      | Notes                                 |
|------------|---------------------------------------|
| Identifier | Unique identifier for the publisher   |
| Name       | Required, Unique, max 255 characters  |
| City       | Nullable                              |

You will need to create the required stubs for Model, Migration, 
API Controller, Requests, Seeder and Routes for the Publishers.

Use resourceful routes for the publishers.

## Exercise 2-02: Model, Migration and Seed

Complete the code for the Publisher's Model, Migration and Sample Seed data.

Run the migration (fresh) and seeders to check all is ok.

## Exercise 2-03: Retrieve (aka Browse & Read)

Create the `index` method for the publishers, returning the publisher list (index).

Create the `show` method so it returns the requested  publisher.

Create and test these two endpoints using Postman.

## Exercise 2-04: Create (aka Add)

Complete the method for `create` publisher.

Ensure you have suitable validation of the data, and suitable messages for failure/success.

Create and use Postman to test the create method.

## Exercise 2-05: Update (aka Edit)
Complete the method for `update` publisher.

Ensure you have suitable validation of the data, and suitable messages for failure/success.

Create and use Postman to test the update method.

## Exercise 2-06: Delete 

Complete the method to `delete` a publisher.

Ensure you have suitable messages for failure/success.

Create and use Postman to test the delete method.
