# Making an API III - Updating Data

So far we have browsed (index), read (show) and added (create) authors. 
Now we need to look at updating them.

# Author API - Update an Author

Updating an author is very similar to creating an author. The main
steps in the process are:

- retrieve author 
- patch the author data
- save the changes
- report back updated author and success

There are other parts we have not included, such as validation of data,
but will implement them as we get to the relevant point.

# Update Author API Request

Let's start with the `UpdateAuthorAPIRequest` as it is very similar to the Store version.

To create the request stub we use the command:

```shell
sail artisan make:request UpdateAuthorAPIRequest
```

The code for the Update request is identical (for the time
being) to the Store.

Copy the code over from one to the other, as needed.

## Update Method

Next we can hit the update method in the AuthorAPIController.

This method will do the following:

- validate data being used for update
- attempt to retrieve the author
- set up default response JSON
- if the author exists, then:
  - update the changed parts of the author
  - save the changes
  - update the response JSON
- send the response

### Validate the Data

Using a request, `UpdateAuthorAPIRequest` allows us to separate the
validation from the controller method, thus shortening it. It also
provides us with a method of returning a custom response, as per the
'create' method.

Start by updating the `authorize` method. This is so we can test 
without authentication:
```php
return true;
```

Next add the `rules()` to validate the data being passed:

```php
return [
    'given_name' => [
        'max:64',
    ],
    'family_name' => [
        'required_without:given_name',
        'max:128',
    ],
    'is_company' => [
        'boolean',
    ]
];
```

Finally the custom responses, `failedValidation`, for validation 
failures, and the `messages` that are sent to the caller:

#### Failed Validation
```php
throw new HttpResponseException(
    response()->json([
        'success' => false,
        'message' => 'Validation errors',
        'data' => $validator->errors(),
    ])
);
```

#### Messages
```php
return [
    'family_name.required_without' =>
           'Either a given or family name is required.',
    'is_company' => 
           'Company must be set to True or False',
];
```

### Retrieve Author

There are two ways to retrieve the author.

- Use the Author's ID and do a Find
- Use resourceful routing to perform the find for us

We will use the Author ID and perform the query ourselves.

First we add the relevant imports to the top of `AuthorAPIController.php`:

```php
use App\Http\Controllers\Controller;
use App\Http\Requests\StoreAuthorAPIRequest;
use App\Http\Requests\UpdateAuthorAPIRequest;
use App\Models\Author;
use Illuminate\Http\Request;
use Illuminate\Support\Carbon;
```

And update the update method's request type from `Request` to our newly created `UpdateAuthorAPIRequest`:

```php
public function update(UpdateAuthorAPIRequest $request, $id) {
```

Then inside the update method we can begin by validating, then we can retrieve:

```php
$validated = $request->validated();
$author = Author::query()->where('id', $id)->first();        
```

### Default Response

Adding a default response means we are able to not use an else,
and shorten the code a little:
```php
$response = response()->json(
    [
        'status' => false,
        'message' => "Unable to update: Author Not Found",
        'authors' => null
    ],
    404  # Not Found
);
```

### If author exists...

When we find the author, we can update them. By using a default 
message, if the author is not found we simply bypass this step:

Verifying we found the author:
```php
if (!is_null($author) && $author->count() > 0) {
```

Performing the update:
```php
$validated['is_company'] = $validated['is_company'] ?? 0;
if (!isset($validated['given_name'])) {
    $validated['given_name'] = $validated['family_name'];
    $validated['family_name'] = null;
}

$author['given_name'] = $validated['given_name'];
$author['family_name'] = $validated['family_name'];
$author['is_company'] = $validated['is_company'];
$author['updated_at'] = Carbon::now();
$author->save();
```

Setting up the response because we performed the update:

```php
    $response = response()->json(
        [
            'status' => true,
            'message' => "Updated successfully.",
            'authors' => $author
        ],
        200  # Ok
    );
}
```
### Send response

And finally sending the response:

```php
return $response;
```

## Testing with Postman

Testing the update requires a little more work. We need to set the 
HTTP method to PATCH, plus we also, due to some browsers/web server
not recognising all HTTP verbs, use the laravel "`_method`" key 
in the body data.

This allows the 'faking' of the PATCH for those systems that do not
recognise the verb.

![PATCH request with valid Author ID](images/postman-update-1.png)

When you send the test, it should come back with a success (200), 
a message, and data containing the updated author. 

![PATCH Succeeded as author found](images/postman-update-2.png)

If an incorrect author ID is given then the update will fail. For example, we give the ID of 999 in the following configuration.

![PATCH with an invalid author ID](images/postman-update-3.png)

Sending this request gives the "failed" message, a 404 (not found) 
error, and the relevant status (false) and author (null).

![PATCH Failed as author not found](images/postman-update-4.png)


# What's next?

That's the update completed.

Next it's onto [Delete](ReadMe-14-API-delete.md).

Before that though, remember to [complete the exercises](ReadMe-90-API-exercises.md).
